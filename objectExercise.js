// create an empty object literal named 'james'

// using dot notation, give james the property 'firstName' with a value of "James"

// using bracket notation, give james the property 'lastName' with a value of "Freeman"

// using bracket notation to access the james object's firstName property, log his firstName
// using dot notation to access the james object's lastName property, log his last name

// create a new object literal named 'sashy' with the following properties/methods :
// 1. a 'firstName' property, with the value of "Sasha"
// 2. a 'lastName property', with the value of "Dunbar"
// 3. a 'saysHello' method, which when called will log "Hello!"
// these should all be created inside of the object literal, ie don't use
// dot or bracket notation to add properties after you've created the object.

// call the sashy object's 'saysHello' method

// for the problems below, you can use whatever notation you prefer (dot vs bracket)

// give the james object an age property and set it to 28

// give the james object a 'hasBirthday' method. when called, this method should
// add 1 year to james's age AND log the following message:
// "Happy birthday! James is now 29". However, the age should refer to his current age,
// so when called again, it should log "Happy Birthday! James is now 30", etc, etc.

// give sashy a 'favoritePeople' property, and set it to an array which contains the names
// of five of her favorite people

//log the third person in this array, accessing it through the sashy object

//add a new friend, "Crabby Crustacean" to sashy's friend list

//come to think of it, sashy makes friends easily. she should probably have a method
// called 'makesFriend' that takes a new friend's name as an argument, and adds it
// to her favoritePeople list

//add a friend to sashy's favoritePeople list using the method you just created

//Bonus: sashy can be tempermental, too. she gets rid of friends sometimes. give her a method
// called 'deletesFriend' that takes a friends name and deletes that friend from the favoritePeople list. if it can't
// find that friend in the list, it logs "Can't find that friend!"
// Hint: use javaScript's built in 'indexOf method'. read the docs if you're not familiar with it.

//Done!
